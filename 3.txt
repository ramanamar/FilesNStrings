    Hello world, it's me.
    How are you, how are you doing?
    I hope you doing well.
    It was a long time since I wrote you.
    I am willing to say that I miss you.
    Write me back whenever you have time for this.
    I'll be looking forward to your letter.

    Best wishes,
    mate.    Hello mate, it's me The World.
    Glad you wrote me. I am doing well, hell busy almost all the time, thought.
    I am missing the old good days, when we used to playing and poking around.
    It was a real fun and joy. Maybe in another life we'll do it again.
    But who knows, maybe this could happen even in this life.
    I wanted you to know that I will always be near you to cover your back, to shield you and guide you.
    You may always count on me.
    Write me back whenever you have time for this.
    I'll be looking forward to your letters.
    Be strong, live long and prosper.

    Yours truly, your friend,
    The World.
